Plan
----
* Migrate examples to test code.
* Rename modules to accord with PEP-8/Twisted coding standard.
* Rename class methods to accord with PEP-8/Twisted coding standard.
* Rename varaibles to remove underscores (convert to camelCase).
* Remove extraneous spaces between operators, parens, etc.
* Add new lines where they should be (no run-ons after colons).
* Standardize indents to be 4 spaces.
* Increment to version 1.0.0.
* Move Table and Cell out of Elements and into their own module.
* Increment to version 1.0.1.
* Make classes new-style.
* Unify the codes in constants.Languages to eliminate redundancy.
* Figure out a better way to do rendering than is currently done.
* Increment to version 1.0.2.

Issues
------
Tested the initial examples; they don't seem to render properly for TextEdit on
Mac OS X.
